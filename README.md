### What is scripter?

Scripter is a minecraft development QoL tool that makes prototyping easier by giving designers an in-game tool to run actions with the bukkit scheduler. The primary objective of this project is to be a viable alternative to Skript, which can often have poor performance and a lack of stability.

It is recommended that you do not take source from an unstable branch and compile a build for production use, 
you should instead use the latest release provided.
If no release is provided, you should wait for one to be made.

The `main` branch will almost always contain the most stable code.
*read below for where the development branch is located*

### Versioning

The development branch is currently located at `main`.
